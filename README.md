# Simple-Bookstore
My Little Bookstore


An online bookstore developed using PHP, HTML/CSS and MySQL.
I used Apache Foundation as the server, 

This bookstore allows a user to register an account, login, search for books, view book â€Ždetails and 
add books to a shopping cart. I developed this project for a university course on PHP.

When I made this project I knew next to nothing about CSS. I keep this project as it is to 
remind myself of my humble beginnings.
